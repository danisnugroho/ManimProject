# ManimProject
MFG 598 Project - Visualization of Nuclear Orbitals

This project is aimed to create visualizations depicting the movement of nucleons within various particles such as deuterons, tritons, and alpha particles, through the use of Python. The precise information about the nucleon positions and movements required for these animations are provided by my Ph.D. colleague [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonfilio-nainggolan-12508415a/).

**Python Libraries used:** <br>
- NumPY
- Pandas
- Manim (Visualization component)
